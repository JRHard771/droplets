# Preface
The original author (SidDoyle / Joshua Hard) included no specific license information for this particular project, at least not that I am able to find. In lieu of more detailed information, I have used the following statements to hopefully "reconstruct" the author's general position on use of their work. This license file will be inserted into the appropriate branches of this repository.
