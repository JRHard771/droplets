# Droplets: Simulated Blood

Droplets is not a mod intended to simply make your game gorier or to add flashy effects.

It's a procedural blood mod that tries to mimic sprays and blood splatters using very basic particles, and it can be adjusted anywhere from Mild drips and squirts to Excessive, gushing sprays. Blood drips from ceilings and makes liquid surfaces, like water, foggy.

This is the blood mod for the Doom player that appreciates attention to detail and added visual complexity.

## New Features
Hideous Destructor compatibility has been updated thanks to [caligari87](https://github.com/JRHard771/droplets/pull/3).

BLUDTYPE.TXT functionality has been lifted from [Nash's Gore Mod](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=62641).
- This allows for increased compatibility with other mods by specifying 
which Actors you want to replace. You can read more about how this 
feature works here:
